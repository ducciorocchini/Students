X11()

# On Mac OS X if you use RStudio or R from the terminal, you must have a copy of XQuartz, the X11 window manager, installed. This is no longer a default install since Mac OS X 10.8. You need to install XQuartz, before installing the nat package. Logout and login for the installation to take effect. You can get it from https://www.xquartz.org/. This page is also linked from the Download R for (Mac) OS X page.
